MEDIAN -"Express the unexpressed!"

An instant messaging platform which can be accessed through scanning a QRcode provided. It is used to overcome the issue of ineffective Q&A time in offline events or meetings. In offline meetings,it is not feasible to expect 300 participants to each ask a question during the five to ten minutes dedicated to a Q&A session. Allocating such a small amount of time to discussion allows only a few vocal people to ask questions while the rest needs to do only listening.

This helps the host to collect audience questions & feedback effectively, and helps to get rid off uninteractive meetings.
